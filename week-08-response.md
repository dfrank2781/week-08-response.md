   In my opinion, both O'neil, and Chalabi brought up good points in each of their respective mediums.  I have definitely noticed a lot of what they were talking about, or can at least say that the overall concepts they discussed are not completely foreign to me. I would say that I have especially fallen victim to the internet marketing scheme different companies play. I find it annoying to simply be googling, or browsing the internet for a new outfit idea, or something that I wanted to further research, only to find it on the left of my screen a day or two later; as I'm doing homework. This can definitely be distracting, as I am someone who desires to stay focused with what I'm doing. I find myself x-ing out of these ads as I'm trying to read my online articles for whatever assignment I have to do. I have even experienced seeing them just hours, or even the very next day after looking up that coveted Jordan shoe, or that new shirt I saw and thought about purchasing online. While continuously putting these items in your face on the side of the screen is a good way to convince one to buy it, I do feel as if it's going a bit far to unwillingly track our internet activity in ways such as this. 

   Another tactic that was discussed came from Chalabi during her TED talk. I found it to be very eye opening, yet true to see and hear how not all data presented is accurate or true 100% of the time. I especially realized this after seeing the pool feces diagram she showed during the presentation. I looked at it thinking, "well that's not so bad it's still mostly clean, but then it seems as if it's nearly all of the diagram that contains feces". It made me see how though figures can often times sounds bigger or smaller than they actually are, not everything is what it seems. It especially resonated with me at the end of her talk when she said that we cannot only go by the numbers we see when it comes to making decisions for ourselves. However, we must also not only go off of our own thinking or understanding as well. As we can see, based off of her evidence, and the aforementioned article, there is power in numbers. How many times we visit a site, or click on things of a certain nature will certainly affect what we see on our computer screens. In many ways, I feel as if this also applies to life, as far as pursuing good and bad habits go. I believe the internet would be more useful, and egalitarian if we all had a choice, similar to smart phone data usage, whether or not we want our browsing history to be tracked. Other times, when you are maybe the one behind some of the content that's being shared this way, as in you created it, it can be more useful. In this case, the internet's algorithm can actually help you push your content out further to bigger audiences. Nowadays, nothing seems to hold more power, or spread quicker than the internet.
